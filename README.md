# Vis
Model of signal processing in the upstream mammalian visual system. Its properties include selectivity for orientation and motion direction.

The code runs in Matlab, and the data file is available at https://drive.google.com/open?id=17CfEVAsv79FhaOlNF0uXynOEbkEWucRA.

Ensure all .m and .mat files are on the Matlab path.

Run anaVis. This should plot a motion direction tuning curve for the excitatory neuron located at (0, 0).

Now open anaVis. The first switch statement controls the analysis. You just ran case resp.dir: try some other cases.
